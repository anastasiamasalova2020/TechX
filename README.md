Overview of the project:
Our project will be a database web application that will provide access to information about Tech companies in the United States,
their main products and technologies, and revenues. Our tool will aim to help young entrepreneurs in finding ideas and testing them
on profitability and occurrence in the United States. The primary features of our product are a simple searching system (which will 
help creators find companies that already work on their ideas), an advanced searching system (which will provide an opportunity to 
test out different ideas for entrepreneurs who haven’t come up with ideas yet), and a graphing tool (for generating graphs for companies’
revenues in different years).
